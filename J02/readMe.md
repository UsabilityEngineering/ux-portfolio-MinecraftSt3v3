# Tretrous Electric Skateboard (skatebolt)

It was a pleasure to receive my first skateboard on my fifth birthday. It featured a Spiderman design and red wheels, and this marked the beginning of my passion for skateboarding. As a freshman in high school, I was able to upgrade to a longboard and use it for bombing hills. Eight years later, electric skateboards have become more popular than ever thanks to advancements in technology.

After riding my friend's boosted board, I found an electric skateboard for $600. It had impressive specifications, including a top speed of 28 mph and a range of 20 miles. The included tool was also useful for making adjustments to the skateboard. The remote control had a speedometer, allowing me to track the 450 miles I traveled around Chico. This was a very **effective** and **effcient** mode of transportation.

However, the remote had some flaws that made it dangerous to use. Firstly, it lacked a trigger for the accelerator, which meant that it could easily be activated in a pocket or hoodie. Secondly, any slight movement of the remote could cause the board to fly out from under the rider, potentially causing injury. I guess one good thing I could say about the remote was that it had a good **mental modal** for how the board should move. Moving the trigger forward makes the go forward, and moving it backward reverses the skateboard.

After two falls, I realized the potential risks of using the electric skateboard and realized that it was not **error tollerant**. Falling at high speeds is incredibly painful, and I didn't want to put myself in that situation again. It was fun while it lasted, the safety concerns were too great to continue using the skateboard. One way this could be avoided is bby having a trigger mechanism on the back of the remote, like this picture below

This prevents the accedental accelerations.
