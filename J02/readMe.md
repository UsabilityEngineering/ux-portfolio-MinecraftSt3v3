# Tretrous Electric Skateboard (skatebolt)

It was my 5th birthday when I got my the first skateboard, I remember it like it was yesterday> The skateboard had a spiderman design and red wheels. This was the start of my skateboarding journey. Fast forward to my freshman year in high school I, was able to get a longboard, wants just any longboard, and got a longboard that was used for bombing hills. Fast forward 8 years, technology has significantly improved, and electric skateboards are more common than ever.

I did some research after riding my friend's boosted board, I happen to find a skateboard for $600, this was a steal for the specs it had. 28 mph top speed, 20-mile range, and also came with a nice tool to make adjustments to the skateboard. The cool thing about the remote was that it had a speedometer I had gone a whole 450 miles, traveling around Chico! The funny thing about the first 450 miles was that I never had a significant fall, this was a very **efficient** way to get to school. Some flaws of the remote controlâ€¦ the remote had no trigger for the accelerator, so this was a hazard because if you had the remote in a hoodie or pocket it could easily trigger the accelerator (which happened many times). Another scenario that could arise is, you're riding down the street to go have lunch with some co-workers, and an older lady smiles at you, you wave back but the remote slides in the palm of your hand triggering the accelerator. Mind you the speed at which you're theoretically going is 20mph, so what happens, is the board slides from under you and you fall on the blacktop of the street. This was the greatest fall I have had on any skateboard. I injured the whole side of my abdomen area my shoulder, knees, and arm all scrapped up. Let's go into detail about the remote. 

**This remote** was not error-tolerant whatsoever, any slight movement and the board could fly from under, injuring the rider.

Here you could see the pciture of the remote, it has a screen and speed modes.

In this picture you can see the accelorator mechanism and how it plain dangerous it can be. 


In conlousion I fell a total of 2 times and they were not fun, falling at high speeds is very painful as you can imagine. I got rid of the skateboard becasue of how dangerous it was. Overall it was fun while it lasted.
